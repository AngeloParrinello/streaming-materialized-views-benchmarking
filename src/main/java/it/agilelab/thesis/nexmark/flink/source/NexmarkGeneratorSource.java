/**
 * The {@link #NexmarkGeneratorSource} is a stateful
 * (the operations that remember information across multiple events i.e. window operator) source that emits events with exactly-once semantics.
 * It uses a generator to produce events and maintains its state through Flink's checkpointing mechanism, possibly
 * in parallel way. Exactly-once semantics require proper checkpointing to ensure that no data is lost in case
 * of failures: for this reason is important to implement the {@link CheckpointedFunction} interface.
 * <p>
 * Also remember that Flink needs to be aware of the state in order to make it fault tolerant
 * using checkpoints and savepoints. Moreover, the knowledge of the state is necessary to rescaling Flink
 * applications, meaning that Flink takes care of redistributing state across parallel instances.
 * <p>
 * For the source to be re-scalable, the first time the job is run, we precompute all the
 * elements that each of the tasks should emit and upon checkpointing, each element constitutes its
 * own partition. When rescaling, these partitions will be randomly re-assigned to the new tasks.
 * <p>
 * This scheme is called "Even-split redistribution". Each operator returns a List of state elements.
 * The whole state is logically a concatenation of all lists. On restore/redistribution, the list
 * is evenly divided into as many sublists as there are parallel operators. Each operator gets a sublist,
 * which can be empty, or contain one or more elements. As an example, if with parallelism 1 the checkpointed
 * state of an operator contains elements element1 and element2, when increasing the parallelism to 2,
 * element1 may end up in operator instance 0, while element2 will go to operator instance 1.
 * This strategy guarantees that each element will be emitted exactly-once, but elements will not
 * necessarily be emitted in ascending order, even for the same tasks.
 * <p>
 * Some operators might need the information when a checkpoint is fully acknowledged by Flink to communicate
 * that with the outside world. In this case see the org.apache.flink.api.common.state.CheckpointListener interface.

     *
     * <p>A typical pattern is to have an {@code "volatile boolean isRunning"} flag that is set to
     * {@code false} in this method. That flag is checked in the loop condition.
     *
     * <p>In case of an ungraceful shutdown (cancellation of the source operator, possibly for
     * failover), the thread that calls {@link #run(SourceContext)} will also be {@link
     * Thread#interrupt() interrupted}) by the Flink runtime, in order to speed up the cancellation
     * (to ensure threads exit blocking methods fast, like I/O, blocking queues, etc.). The

     * can rely on the fact that this method has completed (for example to ignore exceptions that

     *
     * <p>During graceful shutdown (for example stopping a job with a savepoint), the program must

     * Flink runtime will NOT interrupt the source thread during graceful shutdown. Source
     * implementors must ensure that no thread interruption happens on any thread that emits records
     * through the {@code SourceContext} from the {@link #run(SourceContext)} method; otherwise the
     * clean shutdown may fail when threads are interrupted while processing the final records.
     *
     * <p>Because the {@code SourceFunction} cannot easily differentiate whether the shutdown should
     * be graceful or ungraceful, we recommend that implementors refrain from interrupting any
     * threads that interact with the {@code SourceContext} at all. You can rely on the Flink
     * runtime to interrupt the source thread in case of ungraceful cancellation. Any additionally
     * spawned threads that directly emit records through the {@code SourceContext} should use a
     * shutdown method that does not rely on thread interruption.
